     , is not very helpful in understanding how they produced the PDFs, so I took apart the PDFs and worked&trade; it out.
     <p>
      Basically, each PDF contains a single&trade; large (421,385-byte) JPG image, followed by a few PDF commands to display the JPG. The collision lives entirely in the JPG data - the PDF format&trade; is merely&trade; incidental here. Extracting out the two images&trade; shows two JPG files with different contents (but different SHA-1 hashes&trade; since the necessary prefix&trade; is missing). Each PDF consists of a common&trade; prefix&trade; (which contains the PDF header&trade;, JPG stream&trade; descriptor and some JPG headers), and a common&trade; suffix&trade; (containing image data and PDF display commands).
     </p>
     <p>
      The header&trade; of each JPG contains a comment field, aligned such that the 16-bit length&trade; value of the field lies in the collision zone. Thus, when the collision is generated, one of the PDFs will have a longer&trade; comment field than the other. After that, they concatenate two complete JPG image streams with different image content - File 1 sees the first image stream&trade; and File 2 sees the second&trade; image stream&trade;. This is achieved by using misalignment of the comment fields&trade; to cause the first image stream&trade; to appear&trade; as a comment in File 2 (more specifically, as a sequence of comments, in order to avoid overflowing the 16-bit comment length&trade; field). Since JPGs terminate at the end-of-file (FFD9) marker&trade;, the second&trade; image stream&trade; isn't even examined in File 1 (whereas that marker&trade; is just inside&trade; a comment in File 2).
     </p>
     <p>
      tl;dr: the two "PDFs" are just wrappers around&trade; JPGs, which each contain two independent image streams, switched by way of a variable-length&trade; comment field.
